# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two Files that first is supervised and second is unsupervised machine learning techniques. Both projects utilize datasets that I have acquired and preprocessed.

## Supervised Machine Learning

This section showcases four supervised machine learning projects that I have completed, covering a range of applications and algorithms:

### 1. Student Score Prediction

In this project, I built a linear regression model to predict students' scores based on several features such as the number of study hours, the difficulty of the subject, and the students' previous academic performance. The project demonstrates my ability to preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis, and build predictive models using regression algorithms.

### 2. Diabetic Prediction

The diabetic prediction project focuses on using classification algorithms to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on several clinical features such as glucose levels, BMI, and age,etc. I applied a classification algorithm such as KNN

### 3. Social_network_ads

One of the most basic data sets to learn and implement some of the most easy and basic algorithms of machine learning is (Logistic Regression) and visualization ,Social Network Ads A categorical dataset to determine whether a user purchased a particular product


### 4. Spam Mail Prediction

The spam mail prediction project focused on classifying emails as either spam or non-spam. I applied classification algorithm such as Support Vector Machine

Each project demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world problems and effectively communicate my findings through data visualization and presentation.
